### ðŸ‘‹  Welcome To My Github <a href="https://github.com/curtild/SSRS-Projects/"><em>SSRS Sample Projects</em></a> Repository!

#### What's In This Repository?
#### This repository houses SSRS sample reports that reflect SSRS reports found in virtually any organization. 

#### Why SSRS?
#### If you think SSRS is dead, think again. Many companies that have made an investment in SSRS, and who may not seek cloud platforms for security concerns, still receive a great return on that investment. SSRS is a powerful tool for enterprise reporting. Though PowerBI is a great compliment to SSRS, there is still some functionality that hasn't been ported to PowerBI yet. So, SSRS is still here for now.

#### Why Not Microsoft Word?
#### You may wonder if SSRS is overkill when there is Microsoft Word. Well, let me just tell you that Word isn't designed to handle enterprise reporting. Nor does it have subscriptions, etc., that would make it as powerful as SSRS.

#### About My SSRS Sample Projects
#### The sample projects here are based on AdventureWorks databases provided by Microsoft, housed here on Github. They were completed with AdventureWorks 2017, tested with Report Builder 3.0, and updated to Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition. If you'd like to follow along with these samples, for report design you may use either Visual Studio or Report Builder. Should you choose Report Builder, some functionality you get with Visual Studio may be unavailable. If you already have an earlier version of Visual Studio, and you don't have the Business Intelligence add-on SSDT (to create reports), a link to those tools is provided below.
