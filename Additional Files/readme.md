### ðŸ‘‹  Welcome To My Github <a href="https://github.com/curtild/SSRS-Projects/"><em>SSRS Sample Projects</em></a> Repository!

#### What Are These Additional Files?

The additional files are barcodes created for specific reports within this repo. The AdventureWorks sample database is the data source for the barcodes. If you'd like to play around with SSRS designs and barcoding, these QR codes can be imported into your designs. You're welcome! (lol)
