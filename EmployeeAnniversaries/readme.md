### <em>Sample Report â€” Employee Anniversaries</em>
#### ðŸ‘‹ Report Description

#### Nearly every HR department celebrates employee anniversaries. This sample report is a form letter typically designed in SSRS.
#### While building this project, I tried to keep the concept simple. The report contains a drop down selection box to allow a user to select any month to generate anniversary letters. Typically, I've designed this report with conditional SQL to select records for the next month ahead relative to the current date, in order to mail letters a little in advance.
#### The report's data source is <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks">Microsoft's AdventureWorks 2017 sample database</a>. (No proprietary data to worry with!)
#### ðŸ‘‹ Report Design
- #### A SQL view is driven by a monthly parameter to pull employee data with employment start dates. (<a href="/EmployeeAnniversaries/v_EmployeeData.sql"><em>v_EmployeeData.sql</em></a> script is provided to create the view.)
 - #### Embedded data sets <a href="/EmployeeAnniversaries/rsd_Employee_Anniversaries.rsd"><em>rsd_Employee_Anniversaries.rsd</em></a> and <a href="/EmployeeAnniversaries/rsd_Months.rsd"><em>rsd_Months.rsd</em></a> are created to pull data from the view. (SQL files <a href="rsd_EmployeeAnniversaries.sql"><em>rsd_Employee_Anniversaries.sql</em></a> and <a href="rsd_Months.sql"><em>rsd_Months.sql</em></a>  are provided to show SQL for both data sets.)
 - #### To make the report run out of the box you'll need to do 2 things: 1. Create a shared data source named srds_AdventureWorks2017 (or create your own data source name, then adjust your report definition) 2. Adjust the report to include your own entry for your SSRS server.
